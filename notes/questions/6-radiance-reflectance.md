# Radiance vs. Reflectance?

radiance:
- amount of EM radiation (usually light) emitted or reflected by an object or surface in a specific direction. 
- watts per square meter per steradian 
- radiance measurements are taken directly from the sensor's raw data and need to be corrected for various factors like atmospheric conditions and sensor characteristics to derive meaningful information about the Earth's surface.

reflectance:
- normalized measure of how much light is reflected by a surface relative to the light that falls on it 
- it is expressed as a percentage or a unitless value from 0 to 1 
- obtaind by dividing the measured radiance by the incoming solar irradiance and correcting for atmospheric effects 


**radiance represents the raw measurement of EM radiation from a surface while reflectance is a normalized value that indicates the proportion of incoming radiation that is reflected by a surface**.
