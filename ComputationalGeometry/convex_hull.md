# Convex Hull

The smallest convex polygon or polyhedron that contains all given points
in a given set.  
The smallest shape that encloses all the points in a set, while also forming 
a convex (non-intersecting) boundary.

Convexivity -- any line segment connecting two points within the shape lies
entirely inside the shape. 

A convex polygon has all its interior angles less than 180 degrees.  
A concave polygon has at least one interior angle that is more than 180 degrees.
