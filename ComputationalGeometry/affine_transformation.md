# Affine Transformation 

a geometric transformation that preserves lines and parallelism but not necessarily Euclidean distances and angles. 
It maps points to points, lines to lines, and planes to planes.  
An affine transformation does not necessarily preserve angles between lines or distances between points, though it does preserve ratios of distances between points lying on a straight line.  

Eulcidean distance == distance between two points on an XY axis.

affine space -- a vector's space whose origin we try to forget about.  
vector space -- a set whose elements, i.e. vectors, may be added together and multiplied ("scaled") by numbers called scalars.  
vector addition, scalar multiplication...  
vectors have magnitude as well as direction.  
matricies allow computing in vector spaces.  

When are affine transformations used in a geospatial context?  
- map projections. Converting from one CRS to another.  
- image rectification (getting images from various satellites to be on the same CRS)
