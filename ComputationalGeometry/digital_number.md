# Digital Number

- a value assigned to a pixel. 
- usually a value from 0-255 represented by a binary integer 
- represents the raw data from a remote sensing application, has to be preprocessed to be useful for analysis (e.g. converting a DN to a TOA Radiance )


What is TOA Spectral Radiance?
- top of atmosphere spectral radiance 
- radiant energy per unit area per unit solid angle per unit wavelength 
- measured at the top of earth's atmosphere 
- measure of the amount of electromagnetic energy (e.g. light) that is radiated from the Earth's surface and reaches the outermost layer of the atmosphere.
- often used to determine the amount of energy emitted or reflected by various materials on earth's surface 
- different objects have different spectral signatures!
