# Buffer

Create a zone or region around spatial features.  
The buffer zone represents an area within a certain distance from the original 
features. Often represented as a polygon with a width around the input features.  
The distance of the buffer zone is typically specified in the units of the CRS being used.

When is the buffer useful in geospatial applicaitons?
- proximity analysis: identify points that are within a specific distance of a point, line or polygon.
