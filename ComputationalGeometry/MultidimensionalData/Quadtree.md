# Quadtree 

* each internal node has exactly four children 
* used to partition a 2D space by recursively subdividing it into four quadrants or regions 
* root is the square that encompases the entire 2D grid 
* its 4 children are the original 2D grid split into four quadrants 
* leaf nodes are squares that contain geographic objects (e.g. intersect with a line)
