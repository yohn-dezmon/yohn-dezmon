# Intro 

GDAL is written in C.  
There is a GDAL python library, but you have to write python code to mimic C code.  
Rasterio expresses data in GDAL's model.  

The easy way to install rasterio is:  
```
pip install rasterio
```

^ however this is not suitable for full integration with QGIS or for production systems.
