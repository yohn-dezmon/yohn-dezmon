# Python Quickstart

GeoTIFF (file format) is used for this tutorial.  
`.tif` is the file extension for GeoTIFF.  

A **dataset band** is an array of values representing the partial distribution of a single variable in 2D space.  
All band arrays of a dataset have the same number of rows and columns.  
The variable represented by the example dataset's sole band is Level-1 digital numbers (DN).
