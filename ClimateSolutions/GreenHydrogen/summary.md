# Green Hydrogen 

Zero-carbon green hydrogen production: 
- federal government would need to set strict rules for tax credits to require that hydrogen be made with electrolyzers powered by new sources of carbon-free electricity supplied on an hour-to-hour basis. 

Fossil fuel industry preferred approach: 
- they want tax credits to go to hydrogen made from clean electricity that is accounted for on an annual basis from across the country's grid.  
- including "unbundled renewable energy credits"
- they say they need the rules to be looser to begin with, then they can become more stringent over 10 years...


**electrolyzers**:
**unbundled renewable energy credits**:

The Case for Strict Carbon Accounting:
- require hydrogen producers to use new sources of clean energy (additionality). 
- require hydrogen producers to use clean power that can actually reach the production facilities on grids they're connected to... 
- require hydrogen producers to match production and consumption of clean power down to the hourly basis
