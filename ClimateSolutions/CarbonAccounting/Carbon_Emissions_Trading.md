# Carbon Emissions Trading

A form of carbon pricing.
Creating a market with limited allowances for emissions.

Emissions trading works by setting a quantitative limit on the emissions produced by all participating emitters.  
The price (of what?) automatically adjusts to this target.  
This is an advantage in comparison to the `carbon tax`.

In emission trading, a polluter having more emissions than their quota has to purchase the right to emit more.  
The entity having fewer emissions sells the right to emit carbon to other entities.  
The most cost effective carbon reduction methods would be exploited first.  

Units: `tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent`.
What is carbon dioxide equivalent?

Currently other GHGs liek methane or nitrous oxide are not part of these schemes.  


In the "cap and trade" variant of emissions trading, a limit on access to a resource (the cap) is defined and then allocated among users in the form of permits. 

The cap in this case would be the total amount of GHGs that can be emitted by a given sector over a given period of time (e.g. a year).  
The cap should decrease from one year to the next, so we eventually are not emitting any GHGs.  
Emissions allowances (permits).  
Some emissions allowances are given to each company (how is this determined?).
