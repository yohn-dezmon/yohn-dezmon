# Projections

spatialreference.org has the codes of the most commonly used projections.  
A common projection is WGS84.  
The code for WGS84 is `"EPSG:4326"`.  

Common projections and their EPSG codes:
* WGS84 Latitude/Longitude: EPSG:4326
* UTM Zones (North): EPSG:32633
* UTM Zones (South): EPSG:32733


WKT2 is the preferred format to store CRS info. That or SRID.  

2 operations for CRS:
- setting a projection 
- re-projecting  

Most of the time you don't need to load a projection. Data from a reputable source will almost always have projection information.  


To see an object's CRS:  
`gdf.crs`  

If you're loading in data from a spreadsheet with latitude and longitude pairs, there will be no default CRS, so you have to set it!  
```
my_geoseries = my_geoseries.set_crs("EPSG:4326")
my_geoseries = my_geoseries.set_crs(epsg=4326)
```

As of GeoPandas 0.8 you can have different CRS' for different geometry columns.  

`.crs` returns a `pyprojc.CRS` object.  
https://pyproj4.github.io/pyproj/stable/api/crs/crs.html#pyproj.crs.CRS  

These two lines are equivalent: 
```
gdf.crs = "+proj=laea +lat_0=45 +lon_0=-100 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +a=6370997 +b=6370997 +units=m +no_defs"
gdf.crs = "EPSG:2163"
```
so use the second line if you know the EPSG code.  

You can find the EPSG code using the `pyproj` library:  
```
impot pyproj 
crs = pyproj.CRS("+proj=laea +lat_0=45 +lon_0=-100 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +a=6370997 +b=6370997 +units=m +no_defs")
crs.to_epsg()
```

In GeoPandas coordinaets are always stored in (x, y), i.e. (lon, lat).  


pyproj now honours the axis order of the EPSG definition. However, proj4 strings or older WKT versions donâ€™t specify this correctly, which can be a reason that the CRS object is not equal to the expected EPSG code.
